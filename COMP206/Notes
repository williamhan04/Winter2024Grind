# Introduction to Software Systems
## 1-2. Unix/Linex Operating System
### System
- A set of interconnect components (artifacts)
    - Each component performs a specific function
        - Components can interact with one another (send/receive data, execute a fct)
        - They interact with each other according to a set of rules (protocols: HTTP, ssh)
        - They can be subsystems
#### Software Systems
- Involves interactions between software programs
- These softwares work as a team to solve a problem
#### Systems Programming
- Software is often divided in two main types:
    - Application software: services to user
    - Systems software: services to other softwares
- System programming is concerned with systems software, it involves;
    - Directly interacting with either the operating system or the machine
    - May not be easily portable
    - Little runtime overhead and works in low resources environments
    - Manual memory management
#### Command-line development
- Often required
    - Remote systems development
    - OS job-language(scripts to control the OS)
    - Diagnosing OS and peripheral issues
    - Not everything has a graphic user interface (GUI) (e.g. scientific equipment)
- Often prefered by developpers
    - Efficiency (tab completion, pipelining, no deep menus, etc.)
    - Easier to automate (scripts)
    - Easier to share commands than step-by-step instructions
    - Single environment for multiple tasks
    - Flexibility
    - Shell history
    - Customizable
### What is an operating system?
- Piece of software that allows us to interact with a computer without knowing it's inner working
- Manages the computer resources
- Provides us with libraries to interact with these resources
- It manages things for us and helps us control the computer
## 3. The Shell
### What it is
Program that has 3 basic tasks
- get user input
- display OS information
- store session information
### Directory
- Linux directory the same as GUI folder
    - An OS structure that contains files (can be named)
- 4 special directories
    - Home: top folder in  user's directory tree (~)
    - Root: top folder of the OS (/)
    - Current: current folder (.)
    - Parent: folder above (..)
### Path
String that describes the location of a file or directory within an OS
- Absolute path
    - String that begins at the root
    - /dir/dir/file
- Relative path
    - String that begins at current location
    - dir/dir/file or ../dir/dir/file
#### Directory Content
- ls: see content of directory
- ls -l: see content in long format
- ls -l letter.doc: see particular file in long format
- ls -a: display all files,, including hidden
#### Current directory
- pwd: print working directory; displays current directory
- cd: allows user to change directories
#### Directory Manipulation
- cd [directory]: change directory
- ls [options] [directory or file list]: directory content or file permissions
- mkdir [options] directory: make a directory
- pwd: print current working directory
- rmdir [options][directory]: remove directory
#### File Manipulation
- cp [options] file1 file2: copy file1 into file2; creates or overwrites file2
- mv [options] file1 file2: move file1 in file2
- rm [options] file: deletes a file or directory
#### Options for cp, mv and rm
- -i: interactive (cp, mv and rm)
    - prompt and wait for confirmation before proceeding
- -r or -R: recursive (cp and rm)
    - recursively visits a directory, first visiting the files and subdirectories beneath it
- -f: force (mv and rm)
    - don't prompt for confirmation (overrides -i)
#### More file manipulation
- cat [options] files
    - file concatenate and display the concatenated result
- less [options] file
    - page through a text file
- logout
- exit
- man: access manual pages of various commands on the shell (man ls)
- history
- Ctrl + C: force stop program 
- Ctrl + D: force tell program to stop waiting for an input
## 4. Regular Expressions and Wild Cards
### Wild Cards
Symbols used to replace one or more characters in a filename. In Bash:
- *.doc: any pattern
- ?at.doc: any single character
- cat.d[aoz]c: any character within the bracket
    - cat.d[a-d]c = cat.d[abcd]c
    - cat.d[!a]c 
### Filename Expansion (globbing)
- Note that if a filename is hidden, it must be matched explicitly
- Globbing is applied on each segments of a pathname separatly
    - Docs/myfile.txt = */*.txt != *.txt
- Wild cards are interpreted by shell. If they can't be matched, shell won't do anything with them and wild cards will be sent to command literally
    - In a dir with no .doc, echo ls *.doc will echo back ls *.doc and ls will think that you're trying to open a file called *.doc
### Regular Expressions
Other than wild cards, regular expressions allow you to search on more advanced text patterns
#### Popular commands using regular expressions
- grep [options] STRING FILE_LIST:
search
